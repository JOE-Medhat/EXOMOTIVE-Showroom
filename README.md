This repository is dedicated to the EXOMOTIVE Showroom, a specialized web application designed exclusively for showcasing exotic and luxury cars. The platform serves as a premium virtual showroom where users can explore rare, high-performance, and luxury vehicles from world-renowned brands.

EXOMOTIVE focuses solely on exotic supercars and hypercars, offering detailed profiles that include high-quality images, technical specifications, pricing, and unique features of each vehicle. From brands like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Rolls Royce to limited-edition models and custom-built masterpieces — EXOMOTIVE is the go-to destination for exotic car enthusiasts.
The project consists of two main parts:

Frontend: A modern, dark-themed interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to browse exotic car collections, view detailed car pages, and manage user profiles effortlessly.

Backend: A powerful Node.js and Express server that manages user accounts, authentication, saved cars, and dynamic car data retrieval — all centered around exotic vehicles only.
This platform is designed for car collectors, enthusiasts, and anyone passionate about the world of luxury and performance automobiles.
